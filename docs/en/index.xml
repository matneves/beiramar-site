      <description>Beira Mar Servicios Marítimos LTDA. was founded in February 1992 in Salvador, Bahia. We have since been working hard to ensure more agile vessel turnarounds, accurate information and protection of our customers from modern maritime trade vagaries. Our clients receive the best solutions for all their logistical and informational demands, before their vessels reach their destination and during their stay in the port.</description>
